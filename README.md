### Air Alert

This application is extremely important for people who are sensitive to air pollution or care about the environment and want to know ways to reduce their impact on air pollution. Rather than having to manually check the air quality, this app will notify someone by text when the air quality is a certain level. A user can customize the alerts they get, and can also add alerts to remind them when they need to change indoor air filters.

##### Target Audience

* People who are sensitive to air pollution (outdoor and indoor).
* Caregivers of children and seniors who want to know when it is not a good idea for their loved one to go outside.
* The general population who cares about the environment and wants to know information on ways to protect their health and reduce air pollution.
